# Precipice

Precipice is a library that helps you moniter and manage the execution of tasks that can fail. This could be anything from a network request to an external system or specific procedures internal to your application.

## Design

The core abstraction of Precipice is the concept of a **GuardRail**. If you would like to execute a task, you attempt to acquire permits from the GuardRail. The logic determining whether permits are available is based on user configurable metrics and backpressure mechanisms.

Specifically a GuardRail has:

1. Name - used for identification purposes.
2. Result metrics - counts of the different task execution results.
3. Rejection Metrics- counts of the different task rejection reasons.
4. Optional Latency Metrics - latencies for the different task exeuction results.
5. Zero or more back pressure mechanisms informed by these metrics.

There is also a Precipice interface that has a single method to return a GuardRail. This allows the creation of specialized implementations. For example, the precipice-threadpool package includes an implementation that isolates the usage of threadpool with a GuardRail.

## Version

This library has not yet hit alpha. It is used in production at [Staples SparX](http://www.staples-sparx.com). However, the API may still change.

The latest release is available on [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7CPrecipice).

## Usage

### Creating a GuardRail

A GuardRail can be created using the GuardRailBuilder. A name, metrics for tracking results, and metrics for tracking rejections are required. Latency metrics and back pressure mechanisms are optional.

As a note, you must specify enumerated types to define possible results or rejections. There are a number of common options provided. Or you may implement your own.

```java
String name = "Identity Service";
GuardRailBuilder builder = new GuardRailBuilder<>();
builder.name(name);
builder.resultMetrics(new RollingCountMetrics<>(SimpleResult.class));
builder.rejectedMetrics(new RollingCountMetrics<>(RejectedReason.class))
builder.addBackPressure(new LongSemaphore<>(RejectedReason.MAX_CONCURRENCY, 10));

GuardRail guardRail = builder.build();
```

### Using a GuardRail

The simplest way to employ the GuardRail is by using one of the provided factories for completion contexts. These factories implement the logic for the acquiring and releasing of permits.

```java
GuardRail<SimpleResult, RejectedReason> guardRail = builder.build();
CompletionContext<SimpleResult, String> completable = Synchronous.acquirePermitsAndCompletable(guardRail, 1L);

try {
    URL url = new URL("http://www.google.com");
    URLConnection urlConnection = url.openConnection();
    completable.complete(SimpleResult.SUCCESS, readToString(urlConnection.getInputStream()));
  } catch (Exception ex) {
    completable.completeExceptionally(SimpleResult.ERROR, ex);
  }
```

### Using the CallService

The CallService is an provides a Precipice implementation that works out of the box. It takes a GuardRail parameterized with SimpleResult for the result type. It is called with Callables, similar to a ExecutorService. However, the Callables are executed on the calling thread.

The CallService will only execute the Callable if a permit is available from the GuardRail, otherwise will throw an RejectedException. CallService implements the Precipice interface, so you can call the guardRail() method to get its GuardRail. With the GuardRail you can interrogate metrics related to callable results, rejections, and latency.

```java
CallService<RejectedReason> callService = new CallService<>(guardRail);

try {
	Request req = callService.call(() -> client.submitHttpClient());
} catch (RejectedException e) {
	// Handle exception
}
```

### Specialized Implementations

The precipice-samples module provides examples of specialized implementions. These demonstrate how specific protocols or clients can be monitored and managed using a GuardRail.

Two examples are:
- Kafka producer service
- Http client service

Additionally, the precipice-threadpool module provides a production-ready implementation of a threadpool protected by a GuardRail.
